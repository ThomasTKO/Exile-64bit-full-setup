Incoming
2302 (default Arma 3 Game port) + (VON is now part of main gameport due to NAT issues)
2303 (STEAM query, +1)
2304 (Steam port, +2)
2305 (VON port, +3 - not used atm. but allocated)
2306 (BattlEye traffic, +4)
Outgoing
DST Port	Protocol	Destination	Comment
2344	TCP + UDP	81.0.236.111	BattlEye - arma31.battleye.com
2345	TCP	81.0.236.111	BattlEye - arma31.battleye.com
2302-2307	UDP	any	Arma Server to Client Traffic
2303	UDP	any	Arma Server STEAM query port
2304	UDP	any	Arma Server to STEAM master traffic
